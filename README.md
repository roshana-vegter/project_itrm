# Gendered Intensifier Analysis

## General Information

In this research paper we investigate the differences in language between men and women, looking specifically at frequency of usage of intensifiers. Intensifiers play a big roll in language expression and in this study we aim to uncover the differences in their usage patterns between genders.

## Research Question and Hypotheses

**Research Question**: How does the usage of intensifiers differ between women and men?

**Hypotheses**:
Prior research show women tend to use more intensifiers than men. We hypothesise that our study will show that women use intensifiers more frequently. We also think that there is a slight convergence between the number of intensifiers used by men and women.

## Method

**Dataset:**
- The dataset consists of transcribed conversations about diverse topics.

**Variables:**

- **Independent Variable:**
  - **Gender:** Participants will be categorized into two groups: male and female.

- **Dependent Variable:**
  - **Frequency of Intensifier Usage**
